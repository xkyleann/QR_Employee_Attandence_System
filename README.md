## Project Description 
  * QR Code Employee Attendance System is a highly efficient, swift, and user-friendly tool designed for monitoring employee attendance within a company. It leverages the power of QR codes to streamline the process. For instance, when an employee is working online, it logs their login and logout times as timestamps. Our project utilizes **_HTML, CSS, and JavaScript_** to create a web-based interface, making attendance management convenient and accessible. This system seamlessly operates when devices are connected to the same local network.

  * The company can present the QR code through a webpage, or in situations like conferences, attendance can be collected using a projector, allowing present employees to effortlessly scan and record their attendance.


## Key Features

1. **Automatic IP Fetching**: This system automatically fetches your IPv4 address and generates a QR code based on that IP, facilitating easy connections within the same local network.

2. **Company Panel**: The system includes a Company View Panel, giving managers the ability to manage attendances by removing duplicate or proxy entries, ensuring accurate attendance records.

3. **User-Friendly Interface**: With a user-centric design, the interface is intuitive and easy to use, minimizing the learning curve for employees and managers.

4. **Real-Time Tracking**: Attendance can be marked by scanning QR codes with real-time updates, providing immediate and accurate attendance data.

5. **Accessibility**: Attendance records are easily accessible, allowing quick reference and analysis to support decision-making and compliance.
